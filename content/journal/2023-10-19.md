### Today's Thoughts

- I am very frustrated, I missed my NLP quiz today, kinda worried about grades
- I feel like, I am forgetting so many important things
- All the blame goes to my super fucked up sleep scheduling, I was sleeping at 4 a.m and waking up at 12.00 p.m, this is bullshit and idiotic
- I also have so much to learn
- I have to focus on learning blockchain and also focus on DSA, and have very little time, have so many assignments, my lab marks are unsure and I have so many college projects
- Didn't get money from Udhay and also have to complete a lot of via prize bounties

to be precise I just have a list of bad things

### So what did I do to take action against it?

- First I tried hurting myself ðŸ˜‚, to just get off the anger, just started hitting the wall hard while listening to rap music, this kinda took off my anger
- Then thought I was so stupid and downloaded an app "TODO list" ðŸ«£ 
- Put two widgets on the screen, one for remainder and others for todo list

 I found reasons for why, I wasn't sleeping early
#### Reasons
1. I couldn't complete my todolist of the day, which leads to me thinking I can complete it over night, then get distracted and watch some series till end, which again leads to sleep less night
2. Not feeling sleepy at night, probably because I feel sleepy in the afternoons and evenings, (something I should change)

So, I decided to complete all the tasks in the morning itself, instead of procrastinating them to the night, today already done with 50% of the tasks, so going good, dunno how long I can be same

I also am finding that, I keep moving from one thing to other in a 20 min time, so I need to do something for that, just now I was focusing on completing a task of Viaprize, and then I felt something and jumped to writing this journal and I don't I might also jump away from this, but no, i will complete it 

### Todo List for today

1. I have been learning [[smart contracts]], but very slowly,  I just gave like 2 hours time in past 3 days, so want to complete learning it 
2. I will learn a little bit of [[ZK proofs]] and writing circuits
3. I will remove the mono repo of Viaprize (I also have been thinking to move to app router for viaprize, but don't know if it would even run properly on Dipanshu's and Nithin's laptop)
4. Also read the for tomorrow's exam, which I completely forgot about
