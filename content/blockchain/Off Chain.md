One thing I thought was, off chain mean, which is not on blockchain, or the process that happens out of blockchain is generally considered off chain

So basically most of the times you will need to go outside of the chain to attain the data, even if its on a different block chain, so to be Straight 

**When you are using anything out of the native blockchain then it is called as "OFF CHAIN"**
